Google Colaboratory or in short, Colab provides sufficiently powerful platform to run machine learning projects on Jupyter Notebook. The best thing is we can use NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU for free! However there are some [caveats](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).

<hr/>

**Update (2020 August 22):** The dependencies installation workaround is not required anymore.

**Update (2019 April 22):** NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU is now available for free! It has much better performance than K80.

To plot Keras model in Colab, refer to the sample code in the notebook shown below. You can save a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive and run it on Colab by clicking on the `Run on Colab` button.
